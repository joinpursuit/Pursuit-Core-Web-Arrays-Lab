CLI (command line)
Git & GitHub
Value types operators
Variables
conditionals
loops
strings
Arrays
=========================
The non- graphical software CLI
interface -- the interaction betw. users and computers.
change directory
navigate and control the computers from the terminal and run programs like atom and Git
terminalogy like cd ~, pwd

git
local repo -- enables changes in a specific folders
git keep tracks of changes
. git = hidden folders

                      //* Value types operators
Number
    [1 + 2 , math,  special # NaN, infinity, - infinity, can use decimals, can be floating numbers]
Boolean
    [1 === 2 (anything that returns true & false)
    use in conditionals]
Strings
   [anything in quotes " ", ' ' / can be numbers and characters]
undefined
   [value is not define, ex; let b; = undefined]
object
   [typeof[] = object]
null
   [ defined undefined values, null = no values ex. let c = null; ]
                  //* conditionals
definition; statements that is checking for true
ex.
/#1; if (true) {console.log( 'it\' true')} }
/#2; iteniary - ex. (2 <4) ? console.log('2 is less than') : console.log( '2 is larger')  
/#3; let num = 1
/#4: switch(num) {
  case 2:
  console.log('num is 2')
  break;
  case 1:
  console.log('num is 1')
  break;
}
 num is 1


                         //* loops
  for()
  while()
  for(of)


                         //* Strings
      immutable  value ( cannot change)

                          //* Arrays
can add, modify, replace and remove items
push, pop, shift, unshift, splice (can add and remove/ requires .splice(index, items amount, value ))

                    used arrays for tracking items like list

                          //* Strings and Arrays (both)
                          have length and index numbers.
                          both can be slice.
